# lovenet-platform
A "social network" with features specifically designed to help people form new and maintain existing relationships, of any kind; platonic, professional, hobby, romantic, sexual, etc.

Special features would include an interface for specifying private (per user) "trigger words" to automatically hide or warn content that might be upsetting to them, and features for privately defining personal relationships with other users (level of trust, level of physical/emotional intimacy, etc). For these "private" attributes that are only visible by a single user, the platform servers would store each user's private data in an encrypted form, with the decryption key only being present on the end user's devices.

Other basic features would also be included, such as instant messaging, sharing photos/videos (publicly and privately), coordination of groups and events, and more.

The only strict "rule" of the platform is that "non-consensual topics and communication" are not allowed. No harassing, encouraging violence (emotional, physical, sexual), or other activies involving interacting with a party without their consent.
